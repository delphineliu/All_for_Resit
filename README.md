# Resits-
resit includes assignments missed
##The assignment 4 I merged two file (artists and artworks) into one, deleted unwanted columns, explored and visualized the dataset 
My research questions are: 1.Is there a correlation between the number of artworks an artist created and their age at the time of their death?
2. Does an artist live longer make him/her more creative?##The assignment 5.1
I used the open dataset from https://github.com/the-pudding/data.git. I explored and visualized the dataset according to my research question.
My research questions are: 1.Which countries have produced the most Nobel Prize winners and in which categories?
2.Is there any difference the countries winners were born and where they live?
3.Are there any gender disparities in the distribution of Nobel Prizes over time and across categories?
I didn't give specific answer to these questions, I did the data processing and visualization based on these ideas.
Detailed explanation can be seen in the notebook.
